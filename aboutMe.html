        ABOUT ME:<br>
<p>I’m Jan-Marek Lappe, a digital media designer.
Currently i am studying digital-media at the

    .<br><br>
            </p>
<p>I teach my self more an more in web design, video production, photography and programming like java and c++. I didn’t really achieve something big jet, like winning awards or something similar, but i’m young, got a lot motivation and i am working hard to get better. </p><br>

<p>A good design is not just something what looks good, it needs to be clearly functional and easy to use. I always try to create something with the highest level of usability and the simplest way to interact. Less is more. </p><br>

<p>Of course my thinking about design is always in progress, but at the moment, that’s the way i’m trying to go. </p>

MORE ABOUT ME:  <br>
<p>I’am born in Hamburg (Germany) 1994, grew up in Flensburg and visited quite a lot schools. I'm always questioning and try to find the best and fastest way. „We always did it like this“ is not a reason to still do it like this! </p><br>

<p>In 2015 i did a one year volunteer service in Malawi, a small country in East Africa. I worked there in a bicycle NGO called africycle. It was quite a big step for my creation of a personality. It made me ask questions, i never thought before and changed my view on many thinks. Everything i do matters, if i really want to change something and work hard enough, i am able to make a difference. </p><br>

<p>If you interested  in working together with me, feel free to ask me. I would love to be involved in interesting projects, to share knowledge and create.</p>
