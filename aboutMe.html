        ABOUT ME:<br>
<p>I’m Jan-Marek Lappe, a digital media designer.
Currently I am studying digital-media at the

<a href="http://www.hfk-bremen.de/" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">><font color="gray">University of the Arts Bremen </font></a>

    and the

<a href="http://www.uni-bremen.de/" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">><font color="gray">University Bremen </font></a>
    .<br><br>
            </p>
<p>My focus has increasingly centered on web design, video production, photography and programming, mostly java and c++.</p><br>

<p>My thinking about design is always in progress, but right now I try to create everything with the highest level of usability and the simplest way to interact. 
            
<p>I’am born in Hamburg (Germany) 1994 and grew up in Flensburg. I'm always questioning and try to find my own way. </p><br>

<p>In 2015 i did a one year volunteer service in Malawi, a small country in East Africa. I worked there in a bicycle NGO called africycle. It was a big step for my creation of a personality. It made me ask questions, i never thought before and changed my view on many thinks. I realized how privileged I am that I was born here in Germany, so i'll try my best now to get better and make a difference. </p><br>

<p>If you interested  in working together with me, feel free to ask me. I would love to be involved in interesting projects, to share knowledge and create.</p><br>
