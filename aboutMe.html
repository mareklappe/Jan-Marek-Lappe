        ABOUT ME:<br>
<p>I’m Jan-Marek Lappe, a digital media designer.
Currently I am studying digital-media at the

<a href="http://www.hfk-bremen.de/" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">><font color="gray">University of the Arts Bremen </font></a>

    and the

<a href="http://www.uni-bremen.de/" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">><font color="gray">University Bremen</font></a>
.<br><br>
            </p>
<p>My focus has increasingly centered on video production, photography, web design and programming, mostly java and c++.</p><br>

<p>While for me Design is always an open minded process, I try to create everything with the highest level of usability and the simplest way to interact.<br> 
            
<p>I’am born in Hamburg (Germany) 1994 and grew up in Flensburg.
<p>In 2015 I did a one year volunteer service in Malawi, a small country in East Africa. I worked there in a bicycle NGO called africycle. This period was a big step for my personality development. It made me ask questions, I never thought before and changed my view on many things. <br> I realized how privileged I am  beeing born here in Europe, so i'll try my best now to get better and make a difference. <br><br>
    
Therefore I am highly motivated in learning and getting new challenges.

<p>If you are interested  in working together with me, feel free to ask. I would love to be involved in interesting projects, to share knowledge and create.</p><br>
